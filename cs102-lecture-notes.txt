 A few git commands,
1. git clone <ssh_link_of repostory> --> It is used to clone a repostory to your local system where one can make some changes 
   and commit and push the changes to the main branch.
2. git status --> It can be used to check the current status of the git directory. It shows the changes in one's work tree.
3. git remote -v --> It can be used to check the version one has fetched and the version one would push to the main branch. 
   It is basically the URL of the repostory.
4. git add <file_name> --> It can be used to add (stage) a file to be tracked.
5. git commit -m "Some_description" --> It can be used to commit the changes to the branch one is working on with some message.
