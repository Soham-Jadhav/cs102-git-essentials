 A few git commands,
1. git clone <ssh_link_of repostory> --> It is used to clone a repostory to your local system where one can make some changes 
   and commit and push the changes to the main branch.
2. git status --> It can be used to check the current status of the git directory. It shows the changes in one's work tree.
3. git remote -v --> It can be used to check the version one has fetched and the version one would push to the main branch. 
   It is basically the URL of the repostory.
4. git add <file_name> --> It can be used to add (stage) a file to be tracked.
5. git commit -m "Some_description" --> It can be used to commit the changes to the branch one is working on with some message.


May 13 - VS code, markdown instructions

	Today we first went through the Visual Studio Code editor's installation process. This editor has proved to be very useful for editing markdown, HTML, etc.
 It also has many plugins which are quite useful while coding. Then we went through Markdown which is a lightweight markup language. It is mostly used for formating
 text using a plain text editor. A markdown text can be converted into an HTML code in a simple way. It mostly provides only the basic structures and features of HTML.
 '#' is used for the heading (Section). The more the number of hashes the smaller the heading ie. as number of # increase the text becomes smaller.
 
 This is my lab-3 evaluation.
